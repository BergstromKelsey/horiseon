Horiseon website debugging!
This project was fun to do, as it was my first sort of debugging experience. I feel a lot more confident after doing this, I think everything all together is overwhelming, but when I sat down and went through it I surpsired myself, I know more than I think I do.
I learned quite a bit about CSS and how much one little thing can throw off your whole enitre page. Also a lot about tags/class/id and if they are done right in your html, your css will be alot shorter because you wont be writting the exact same css 10 times, simply just target the one class/tag/id
